# Triangle-Exercise

Create two Java Programs named TriangleVer1.java and TriangleVer2.java. 
Both codes should display the same output, a triangle having four layers of asterisks:
//    *
//   ***
//  *****
// ******* 
For TriangleVer1.java you can use several System.out.println() methods. 
But for TriangleVer2.java try to use only one (1) System.out.println() method. 
Explore the use of \n, \t and spaces to format your triangle
